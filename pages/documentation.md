# Documentation



## Fundamentals


### How it works
{: data-template="main-dependencies"}

iTowns uses multiple bricks to display a wide range of data such as
ortho-images, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) or 3D models. Among those bricks,
the preeminent ones are the following:

##### ThreeJS

JavaScript-based WebGL engine that can run GPU-powered games and other
graphics-powered apps straight from the browser. The three.js library provides
many features and APIs for drawing 3D scenes in your browser.

##### WebGL

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance
interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser  without the
use of plug-ins. WebGL does so by introducing an API that closely conforms to
OpenGL ES 2.0 that can be used in HTML canvas elements.

##### Proj4JS

Proj4JS is a JavaScript library to transform coordinates from one coordinate
system to another, including datum transformations. Originally a port of PROJ
(then known as PROJ.4) and GCTCP C (Archive) it is a part of the MetaCRS group
of projects.
