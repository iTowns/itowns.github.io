# About iTowns

iTowns is an open-source framework designed for the efficient visualization,
navigation, and interaction with 2D and 3D geospatial data on the web. It
empowers users in creating their own customized 3D geographic applications
effortlessly.



## Choosing iTowns


### A multitude of use cases

##### Explore diverse geographic datasets

- Flexibility
- Customisation

First-class support of geospatial standards, enabling seamless composition of
diverse datasets.

Want to visualize your data over a plan or on a globe? That's up to you!

##### Build digital twins

- Digital replicas
- Interaction

A robust platform for seamlessly navigate and interact with digital replicas of
real-world environments.

##### Manipulate BIM data

- BIM
- Spatial information

Effortlessly visualize precise 3D data, including Building Information Modeling
(BIM).


### Built for the community

##### Build your own geospatial service

Made for those who want to build easily their own geospatial visualisation
service.

##### Open governance

Based on an open governance system that allows everyone to contribute.

##### Frictionless and easily extendable

Easily extendable and easy to handle.


### Key features

#### Swiss army knife for geographic data

iTowns offers a comprehensive toolkit for visualizing, interacting and composing
diverse spatial datasets. Mix point clouds, terrain, orthophotos and vector data
in a single view!

##### Easily extend the engine for your needs

##### Build your application from simple blocks


### Multiple format support

##### OGC 3D Tiles

Rely on 3DTilesRendererJS to support streams of point clouds and batches of
heterogeneous 3D models. Visualize and interact with massive datasets such as
urban infrastructure.

##### 2D GIS formats

Retrieve aerial images or terrain tiles from OGC mapping services, and render
vector data from GeoJSON, KML, or Mapbox Vector Tiles. Add depth to your vector
data by extruding it!

##### Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) and Style

Handles Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) datasets along with its styling. iTowns
stylization mechanism allows you to easily stylize the rendered data according
to your preferences.

##### Point clouds

Native integration of the most widely used point cloud formats, including
Potree, Entwine and COPC. Effortlessly visualize the outcomes of your
acquisition and fine-tune the visualization to your needs.
